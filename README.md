# Wispe

Wispe is a TypeScript React Electron application with an Express Node.js backend. It serves as an application to allow multiple users to coordinate events, tasks, or to communicate in real-time. It is intended to be deployed onto a touchscreen Raspberry Pi so that it can be placed on your desk as a decoration.

## Features
- Wifi Setup - Allowing a simple setup process and the ability to be deployed as a Kiosk application on a Raspberry Pi
- API Authentication - All access is strictly to users you created. No unauthorized users can be registered without your approval
- Shared Calendar - Perfect for sharing events or counting down to milestones
- Shared Todo List - For when you want to see what's left to do while not in-person
- Shared Whiteboard - Intended for silly drawings
- Shared Gallery - Upload photos to a gallery visible to all authenticated users on your API node
- Auto-Update - Automatically updates to the latest Github Release
